# 🦍 HAM - The Ape Who Made The Moon Possible

A modern, animated Next.js website for the HAM memecoin - honoring the first hominid in space.

## 🚀 About HAM

Ham was a chimpanzee who flew to space on January 31, 1961, aboard Mercury-Redstone 2. His successful 16-minute flight proved that living beings could survive in space, paving the way for human astronauts like Alan Shepard, John Glenn, and eventually Neil Armstrong's moon landing.

This website is a tribute to Ham's legacy and serves as the home for the $HAM memecoin - a 97% community-owned token that honors the ape who made the moon possible.
